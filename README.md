  The purpose of the code is to explore, using t-tests between pairs of sports, the hyphothesis that given that an area has two sports teams in different sports, these teams will perform the same within their respective sports. For the computation of the p-value, the win/loss ratio of the sport teams per region are used.

  The data for the metropolitan areas and associated sport teams are taken from assets/wikipedia_data.html. The data for the sport teams required to calculate the win/loss ratio are taken from "assets/nhl.csv" for hockey (NHL), "assets/nba.csv" for basketball (NBA), "assets/mlb.csv" for baseball (MLB) and "assets/nfl.csv" for american football (NFL). All the datasets require cleaning.
  
  This small project is part of an assignment for the "Introduction To Data Science" course by the University Of Michigan, hosted on Coursera.
